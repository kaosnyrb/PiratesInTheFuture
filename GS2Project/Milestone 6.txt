Changelog:
Update Triangle List in visualisation component to accept a height map array.
Created Visualisation interface for creating Triangle lists.
Created in the world core a "Sea" class, containing the ripple algorithm.

Test:
Draw a flat triangle list, representing the "sea" in the game.
Result:
A flat quad made of triangles was created and displayed correctly.

Test:
Draw a non-flat triangle list, by passing an array from the sea class in the world to the 
triangle list in the visualistion.
Result:
Non-flat list drawn, without correct normals.

Test:
Test the ripple algorithm by connecting it to the triangle lists height map.
Result:
Rough version of the ripple algorithm in place, tweaking required.
